TODOS:
- Write the logs to a file ~/.local/share/mmtime/mmtime.log and then on system wake up from hibernation 
or suspend, see which signal is sent to the process.
Check if SIGSTOP is sent to the process on hibernation/suspend, and check if SIGCONT is sent to the process 
on hibernation/suspend wake up. 

Bonus: 
- Create an applet for this little program (https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~geod/indicator-workspaces/main/view/head:/indicator-workspaces)


Notes:
- To act on power mode change, you need to add hooks for power mode changement; https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PowerManagement/ReducedPower
