TODOS:
- See which signal is sent to the process. Check if SIGSTOP is sent to the process on hibernation/suspend, 
and check if SIGCONT is sent to the process on hibernation/suspend wake up. 

Bonus: 
- Create an applet for this little program (https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~geod/indicator-workspaces/main/view/head:/indicator-workspaces)


Notes:
- To act on power mode change, you need to add hooks for power mode changement, or you can setup a hypotherical
syspension/hibernation minimum time and then check if the last time you've monitored a task is before current time 
by that hypotherical period or not, if that is the case then you can assume that there was a suspend/hibenation.
i.e  if time.Since(lastMonitor) > hypotherical_sys_hibernation_min_time then hibenation_occured = true
(NOTE): that is what I implemented to check for hibernation/suspend. I set a hypotherical min time period of 6 min.
Which means that I won't consider a hibernation/suspend unless there is a 6 minute sudden offset between two monitoring
instants.
