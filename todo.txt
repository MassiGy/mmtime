TODOS:

Bonus: 
- Create an applet for this little program (https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~geod/indicator-workspaces/main/view/head:/indicator-workspaces)


Notes:
- To act on power mode change, you need to add hooks for power mode changement, or you can setup a hypotherical
syspension/hibernation minimum time and then check if the last time you've monitored a task is before current time 
by that hypotherical period or not, if that is the case then you can assume that there was a suspend/hibenation.
i.e  if time.Since(lastMonitor) > hypotherical_sys_hibernation_min_time then hibenation_occured = true
(NOTE): that is what I implemented to check for hibernation/suspend. I set a hypotherical min time period of 6 min.
Which means that I won't consider a hibernation/suspend unless there is a 6 minute sudden offset between two monitoring
instants.

- As for signals, I beilive that in linux, on suspend/hibenation proceses receive a SIGSTOP from the system, and 
then on system wake up, they receive a SIGCONT. On shutdown, they receive a SIGTERM, and if they persist for long
the system sends a SIGKILL to finish the process. So you can not easily log that with your program, since SIGSTOP 
and SIGKILL can not be trapped (handled as wanted). Besides, that explains how processes continue thier job just
after the system wakeup after a hibernation/suspend.
